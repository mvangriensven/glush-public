Glush is a device tracking and DDNS tool that monitors the uptime of devices, servers and nodes supporting Dynamic DNS domains.
As of right now, Glush is in a public alpha testing phase in which the reliability of our service will be tested under pressuring circumstances to ensure availability.
Glush is free to use up to 5 devices and 5 nodes, with subscriptions and an easily accessible Dynamic DNS Service to be introduced in the future.
